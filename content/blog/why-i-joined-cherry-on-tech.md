## Welcome!

Welcome to Cherry on Tech! This is a post about my experience joining a tech squad, what it means to me to be a Cherry on Tech. 

## TL;DR

Together four other cherries, we founded Cherry On Tech in the summer of 2020. We are a tech squad - a group of people who want to help each other advance in our careers, continue learning together, and provide support and accountability. The idea came from [Mo Hampton](https://twitter.com/moxiehampton)'s talk, "[Breaking into Tech From the Trenches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N5fI5j-IIs)." If you want to know more about what Cherry On Tech is doing, or if you are interested in starting your own tech squad, get in touch! I'm glad to share what I've learned.

## What is a tech squad?

Well in this case, a tech squad is a group of people committed to helping each other enter, or level up, in the tech industry. We lean on one another when we are feeling down, and we assume different roles, so we can make well-projects.

## How did it all start?

At [JuneteenthConf 2020](https://juneteenthconf.com/), software engineer [Mo Hampton](https://twitter.com/moxiehampton) gave the talk, "[Breaking into Tech From the Trenches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N5fI5j-IIs)," which detailed some of her journey making a mid-career pivot into tech from a non-traditional background as a United States Army veteran, a Black woman, and a mother. As part of her suggestions on networking, Hampton talks about finding a tech squad. Hearing her advice to find the people with whom you can share your insecurities and receive honest feedback was absolutely inspiring.

Then, sometime in July 2020, designer [Julieth Fajardo](https://www.juliethfajardo.com/) posted on a slack group for women in tech. She wanted to know if anyone wanted to get together and do a project together. Famous last words!ðŸ¤£ When we met, we decided to make the project an ongoing thing. We liked the idea of becoming a tech squad, and the rest is history (or rather, the rest is for another blog post).

## Why join a tech squad?

### Life long learning...out loud

Tech professionals are often pictured alone, coding without interacting. In my experience, that's pretty far from the truth. I spend at least as much time communicating with my teammates as I do alone. We give and receive feedback, discuss problems and ideas, and pair program a lot. We support each other with information, understanding, and lots of GIFs. 

Outside of work, this kind of closeness is harder to find. I want to demonstrate the skills that I am developing with real projects. I also want to teach others what I do know. For me, working collaboratively is the best way to achieve both of those objectives.

### Support and accountability

I want support and accountability from a few people who really know me - they've seen my features _and_ my bugs. I want people who can see me in my weaker moments and help me out - whether through giving me reality checks, technical advice, or just their vote of confidence.

I also want to _give_ support. Giving support reminds me that I'm not alone, and that I do, in fact, know some stuff. (It also makes me double check the stuff I think I know!) I have been in tech for a few years, and now it's my turn to open the gates even wider. For other cherries,Sharing that with other cherries Being in a squad means I can get to know the people really well. I can help look for resources and opportunities that are really tailored to their situation. I can help them address their own worries and insecurities early and often.

### Prepare for the job market

Right now I have a job I love, and I hope that doesn't change! That said, I strongly believe in being prepared for a changing market - if not for myself, then in order to support our other squad members. Many of the other cherries are currently on the job market, and it is part of my mission to help them get jobs they love, too. (If you are looking to hire, send us a [DM on Twitter]()!)
