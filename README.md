# Welcome to Cherry On Tech's website

We are a tech squad! We support each other as we learn and grow in our tech careers. We got the idea from Mo Hampton's JuneteenthConf talk, "Breaking into Tech." Learn more about us in an upcoming blog post!

## Tech stack

This website is built using Gridsome, a static site generator based on VueJS. It's under pretty heavy construction, but we love it already, and we hope you do, too!

## Installation

1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have it: `npm install --global @gridsome/cli` or `yarn global add @gridsome/cli`
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/cherryontech/website.git`
1. `cd website`
1. `npm install` or `yarn install`
1. Run `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server and see the project in action
